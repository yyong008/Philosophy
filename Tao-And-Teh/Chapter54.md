# 第五十四章

善建者不拔，
善抱者不脱，
子孙以祭祀不辍。

修之于身，
其德乃真，
修之于家，
其德乃余，
修之于邦，
其德乃丰，
修之于天下，
其德乃普。

顾以身观身，
以家观家，
以乡观乡，
以邦观邦，
以天下观天下。

【译文】

合道境地的人，他的建树根柢牢固，他的抱持不会脱落，他的事业将世代承继不衰。修道于自身，其德才纯真；修道于家族，其德才充裕；修道于乡里，其德永绵延；修道于邦国，其德才丰厚；修道于天下，其德才普泛。所以，以自身观想德身，以我家观想德家，以自乡观想德乡，以我邦观想德邦，以现今之天下观想厚德之天下。我是怎么知道现今天下之状况的呢？就是拿它与观想的厚德之天下相比较而得知的。

【英文1】

1. What (Tao's) skilful planter plants
Can never be uptorn;
What his skilful arms enfold,
From him can ne'er be borne.
Sons shall bring in lengthening line,
Sacrifices to his shrine.

2. Tao when nursed within one's self,
His vigour will make true;
And where the family it rules
What riches will accrue!
The neighbourhood where it prevails
In thriving will abound;
And when 'tis seen throughout the state,
Good fortune will be found.
Employ it the kingdom o'er,
And men thrive all around.

3. In this way the effect will be seen in the person, by the observation of different cases; in the family; in the neighbourhood; in the state; and in the kingdom.

4. How do I know that this effect is sure to hold thus all under the sky? By this (method of observation).
